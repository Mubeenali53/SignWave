  🖐️ Hand Gesture Recognition for Sign Language 🤖🎤
</h1>

Welcome to the **Hand Gesture Recognition System**! 🚀 This project aims to **bridge communication gaps** by recognizing sign language gestures in **real-time** using **flex sensors** and an **IMU6050** sensor embedded in gloves. The system translates gestures into **text** and converts them to **speech** for better accessibility. 🎙️💬

## 📌 Features  
✔️ **Real-time gesture recognition** using sensor-based gloves  
✔️ **Sign language to text** conversion 📝  
✔️ **Text-to-speech (TTS) integration** 🔊  
✔️ **Machine Learning for accurate classification** 🤖  
✔️ **Potential NLP and online learning enhancements**  
✔️ **Cloud deployment on AWS EC2 (planned)** ☁️

## 🖥️ Software & Libraries  

📌 **Programming Languages:**  
- Python 🐍  
- C++ (for microcontroller programming)  

📌 **Libraries & Dependencies:**  
- `numpy` ➜ Data processing  
- `scikit-learn` ➜ Machine Learning model  
- `TensorFlow / PyTorch` ➜ (Future deep learning integration)  
- `speechRecognition` ➜ Text-to-Speech conversion

## 🚀 How It Works  

1️⃣ **Sensors detect gestures:**  
   - **Flex sensors** measure finger bending angles  
   - **IMU6050** tracks hand movements  

2️⃣ **Data Processing:**  
   - Sensor data is sent to a **microcontroller**  
   - Features are extracted and sent to a **gesture classification model**  

3️⃣ **Classification:**  
   - Machine Learning model **predicts the gesture**  
   - Text output is generated  

4️⃣ **Speech Conversion:**  
   - The text is passed through a **Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine**  
   - The recognized word/sentence is **spoken aloud** 🔊
